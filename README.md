# starbucks-analysis
This project is the capstone project of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program.

## Problem Statement
The data set of this project contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer. We combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine what kind of offer will be the most effective to stimulate conversion, in other words, which offer to send to each customer.
